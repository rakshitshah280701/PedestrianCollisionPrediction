                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>The experimental methodology was designed to rigorously test the PedView system’s pedestrian detection and collision prediction capabilities under various conditions. This section details the setup, execution, and evaluation criteria of the experiments conducted.</p>
        
                <h3>Experimental Setup</h3>
                <p>The experiments were conducted using a forward-facing monocular camera mounted on a test vehicle. The camera was calibrated to ensure accurate depth perception and field of view alignment. Data collection took place in both controlled environments and in real-world urban settings to capture a wide range of pedestrian behaviors and scenarios.</p>
                
                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>Data was gathered across multiple days at different times to include diverse lighting and weather conditions, which affect visual detection systems. The nuScenes and nuScenes-collision datasets provided additional simulated and real-world scenarios for comprehensive testing.</p>
                
                <h3>Testing Procedures</h3>
                <p>Each test scenario was run multiple times to ensure reliability of results. The system’s responses were recorded in terms of detection accuracy, response time, and the correctness of collision predictions. Pedestrian paths and vehicle dynamics were also logged for detailed analysis.</p>
        
                <h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>
                <p>The performance of the PedView system was evaluated using several key metrics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Average Precision (AP):</strong> Measures the accuracy of the pedestrian detections at different IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Assesses the system’s ability to detect all relevant instances of pedestrians within the scene.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precision:</strong> Evaluates the correctness of the detections, ensuring that the detected objects are indeed pedestrians.</li>
                    <li><strong>False Positives and False Negatives:</strong> Tracks the rate of incorrect detections and missed detections, which are critical for assessing the reliability of the system in real-world applications.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
                <p>Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data collected from the experiments. This included variance analysis to determine the consistency of the system under different conditions and t-tests to compare the performance of PedView against traditional detection systems.</p>
