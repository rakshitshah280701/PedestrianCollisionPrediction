                <p>The transition from handcrafted to deep learning features marks a significant evolution in pedestrian detection. While handcrafted features were engineered based on specific domain knowledge, deep learning models learn to identify useful features autonomously from large amounts of data, providing enhanced detection capabilities [3].</p>
                <p>In the context of PedView, leveraging deep learning models facilitates more robust detection across various scenarios, ensuring higher accuracy and reliability of the system in urban settings [3].</p>

                <h2>Monocular Camera for Pedestrian Detection</h2>
                <p>The PedView system's capabilities can be significantly augmented by adopting monocular camera-based pedestrian detection techniques, as elucidated in recent research [3]. Unlike systems that rely on complex and costly multi-sensor setups, monocular cameras offer a cost-effective yet powerful solution for pedestrian detection in diverse environments.</p>
                <p>In the discussed study [4], the monocular camera employs advanced computer vision algorithms to detect pedestrians accurately. One key technique involves the use of CENTRIST (CENsus TRansform hISTogram) descriptors, which are effective in capturing structural and textural information from the visual data captured by the camera. This method is particularly robust in varying lighting conditions and provides reliable data that is crucial for the detection process.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the use of Sobel image processing techniques enhances edge detection, a critical factor in delineating pedestrian figures from complex urban backgrounds. By applying the Sobel filter, the system can highlight vertical edges—typical in human silhouettes—thus improving the accuracy of pedestrian detection.</p>
                <p>Together, these techniques enable the PedView system to efficiently and accurately detect pedestrians using just a single camera lens, which simplifies the system architecture while maintaining high performance standards. This approach not only optimizes the cost and complexity but also enhances the adaptability of the system to different vehicles and urban settings [4].</p>
