                <h2>Introduction to PedView</h2>
                <p>PedView is an advanced pedestrian collision prediction system designed for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). It leverages a forward-facing monocular camera and a fuzzy control system to accurately predict pedestrian collisions. By utilizing 3D object detection and integrating fuzzy logic, PedView provides a cost-effective alternative to systems that rely on LiDAR or stereo cameras. This makes it especially useful for resource-limited environments like dealer-installed ADAS systems.</p>

                <h2>Monocular 3D Pedestrian Detection</h2>
                <p>PedView's pedestrian detection is powered by a monocular 3D object detection system. Unlike conventional 2D detection methods, PedView locates pedestrians in 3D space, providing more accurate information about their distance, size, and movement.</p>

                <h3>Key Components:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Backbone Network (Swin-small):</strong> Extracts features from images to improve pedestrian detection accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>FPN Neck:</strong> Adapts to different pedestrian sizes and viewing angles, improving robustness in various scenarios.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Bounding Box Regression:</strong> Provides precise location and movement data of pedestrians in the scene.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This system generates a 7-DoF (degrees of freedom) 3D bounding box for each pedestrian, allowing PedView to track their motion and distance from the vehicle. By utilizing the pinhole camera model, it converts 2D image data into accurate 3D coordinates, providing crucial information for the collision prediction algorithm.</p>

                <h2>Fuzzy Control System for Collision Prediction</h2>
                <p>The fuzzy control system is central to PedView’s collision prediction capabilities. Fuzzy logic allows the system to assess collision risk based on the pedestrian’s position, distance, and movement. It categorizes the risk level into three categories: low, medium, and high.</p>

                <h3>Fuzzy Inputs:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lateral Distance:</strong> The distance of the pedestrian from the side of the vehicle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longitudinal Distance:</strong> The distance of the pedestrian in front or behind the vehicle.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movement Status:</strong> Whether the pedestrian is stationary or moving.</li>
                </ul>
