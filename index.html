                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>Recent advancements in pedestrian collision prediction highlight the growing efficacy of monocular camera systems, which offer a cost-effective yet robust alternative to traditional sensor-based systems. This tutorial reviews several cutting-edge approaches, including the PedView system, which integrates fuzzy logic with 3D detection for dynamic risk assessment in real-time. Other discussed methodologies leverage deep learning for enhanced object detection and precise localization in 3D space, providing insights into their operational frameworks, performance metrics, and practical applications. Through theoretical discussions and practical demonstrations, this tutorial aims to equip users with a deep understanding of how monocular camera systems can be optimized for pedestrian detection and collision prediction, reflecting the latest innovations and research findings in the field.</p>
